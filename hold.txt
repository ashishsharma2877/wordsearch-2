Things that need to get done in September/ October:

1. Fix the bug with the dropdown on Graphemes. It scrolls very large.
2. Add a selection bubble on each set of concept groups to show how many in that group were selected
3. Make a list of selected concepts that can be viewed
4. Make a drag/drop so words can be added or removed to and from lists. Or make them data tables if that helps.
5. Enable print /save functionality so a list of words can be printed or saved as PDF
